# NumPy vs. Python List: CRUD Operations and Performance Comparison
This repository contains a Python notebook that compares CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and performance between NumPy arrays and Python lists. The comparison includes:

- **Creation**: Initializing an array and a list.
- **Reading**: Accessing elements in both data structures.
- **Updating**: Modifying elements within the array and list.
- **Deletion**: Removing elements from both data structures.
- **Performance**: Measuring the time taken to perform operations on large arrays and lists.
